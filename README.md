## Calculate unit price

The "Unit Price" (or "unit cost") tells us the cost per liter, per kilogram, per pound, etc, of what we want to buy.

Just divide the cost by the quantity:

2 liters for $3.80 is $3.80/2 liters = **$1.90 per liter**

So this tool will calculate unit price in real-time, and when you click on 'Sort', the lowest Unit Price (and the best bargain) will appear on top of the table.
